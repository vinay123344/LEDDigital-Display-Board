# LEDDigital-Display-Board
Developed a Bluetooth (HC-05) based LED Digital Display Board(P10) to display information at public places. It was installed in my college lab to display a notice to students, a new feature of this board is that it supports googleâ€™s speech to text. You can send information either through text or through voice.
